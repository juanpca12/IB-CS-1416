## Fibonacci Sequence - Golden Ratio Relationship

The Fibonacci Sequence is the sequence of numbers where

t<sub>n</sub> = t<sub>n-1</sub> + t<sub>n-2</sub> and t<sub>1</sub> =  1, t<sub>2</sub> = 1

1. Write an algorithm which generates the first ```n``` Fibonacci numbers and calculates the ratio between two consecutive terms.
2. Generalize the algorithm by making the initial values (```t1``` and ```t2```) arbitrary (i.e. not hard coded as 1).

*Optional:*

1. Implement the algorithm using a Python program.
2. Produce a plot and show that the ratio (r) tends to the Golden ratio as n becomes larger (plot n-vs-r.)

Here is a sample plot:
